Title: Performance analysis of Machine Learning (ML) software

Duration: 1 day

Exercise: 
A team developing an ML application has requested some analysis be done on the performance data produced by their testing infrastructure. The data is contained within two files (TestInfo.csv & TestResults.pickle) and are provided to you. You are tasked with analysing the performance data and providing a summary of your findings in bullet point format. 

Deliverables: 
1) Bullet point summary of your findings. 
2) Visualisations that helped you analyse the data with added annotations. 
3) Follow up actions regarding your findings you would take with the development team 

Guidance: 
The data within the two files are related to each other by the field 'TestId'.
TestResults.pickle was generated using pandas and Python2.7. 
Please include any reasons/justifications in your summary as to why the observed behaviour has occurred.
